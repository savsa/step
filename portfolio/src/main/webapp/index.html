	<h1>What I enjoy photographing</h1>
	<p>I enjoy doing portrait photography and taking pictures of my friends. I recently got a new DSLR camera and have been really enjoying what it can do.</p>

	<h1>Hidden talent</h1>
	<p>A hidden talent I have is piano because I never really perform or play in front of anyone. It's just something that I enjoy doing on my own and taking lessons. I only perform when I have to and I get enjoyment out of just learning and getting better.</p>
